# Feature Specification: Custom Light & Dark Mode Preferences

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-custom-gorgeously`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create custom gorgeously minimalistic to the point Light and Dark mode options under account settings for CODA. We need to MAKE SURE that all text is readable when switching between light and dark modes."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a signed-in Coda user, I want to switch between minimalist light and dark themes from my account settings so that the workspace always feels visually consistent and easy to read regardless of ambient lighting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the Account settings page, **When** I toggle from the current theme to the opposite mode, **Then** the UI updates immediately with the selected minimalist palette and all text remains readable (meets WCAG AA contrast for body and interactive text).
2. **Given** I have saved a theme preference previously, **When** I sign back in on any supported device, **Then** the application loads with my saved theme without flicker or unreadable text.

### Edge Cases
- First-time visitors with no stored preference see the minimalist dark mode immediately alongside a 10-second prompt asking whether to stay in dark or switch to light.
- If a stored theme preference is missing or corrupted, the system silently falls back to minimalist dark mode and logs a warning for diagnostics.
- If OS high-contrast accessibility settings are enabled, the app defers to the OS styling, ensuring text and controls remain WCAG AA compliant even if that overrides our minimalist palette.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Account settings MUST expose a simple control that lets authenticated users switch between the minimalist light mode and dark mode.
- **FR-002**: The selected theme MUST persist per user and be applied automatically on subsequent sessions (Auth.js / PostgreSQL storage per constitution constraints).
- **FR-003**: When no preference exists, the app MUST launch in minimalist dark mode and display a 10-second prompt allowing the user to stay in dark or switch to light.
- **FR-004**: Theme changes MUST update the UI instantly without a full page reload and without momentary unreadable states.
- **FR-005**: Both themes MUST keep all text, interactive elements, and critical icons at or above WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text/icons).
- **FR-006**: Theme selection MUST honor system preferences when the user has not explicitly set a choice, and fall back to the product’s default without violating Lighthouse ≥ 90 or performance budgets.
- **FR-007**: If OS high-contrast accessibility settings are active, the app MUST defer to those styles even when they override our minimalist palette.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide guidance in copy or visual affordance to indicate which theme is active.
- **FR-009**: System MUST degrade gracefully if theme storage fails—default theme loads and the user is informed non-intrusively.
- **FR-010**: If a stored theme preference is missing or corrupted, the system MUST default to minimalist dark mode and log the incident for diagnostics.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Preference**: Represents a user’s explicit theme selection. Attributes include user identifier, theme value (light | dark), timestamps for when chosen, and source (explicit toggle vs system default).

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: When a signed-in user has no stored theme preference, what should the app display on first load? → A: Default to dark mode and show a 10-second prompt to confirm or switch to light mode.
- Q: If a stored theme preference is missing or corrupted, how should the app recover? → A: Fall back to minimalist dark mode and log a warning.
- Q: If OS high-contrast accessibility settings conflict with our minimalist theme choice, what should we do? → A: Always defer to the OS high-contrast setting.

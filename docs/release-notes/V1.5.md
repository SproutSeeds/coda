# Coda CLI v1.5 Release Notes

## Highlights

- Launched a `/legal` center with polished pages for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Acceptable Use, DMCA, and the Data Processing Addendum. Each page renders directly from the repo’s markdown and mirrors the dashboard header for a cohesive experience.
- Hardened authentication by requiring an explicit “By continuing…” consent on both magic-link and password logins; every acceptance is now tracked in the new `document_acceptances` table with document slug, version, and timestamp.
- Refined mobile headers so the “Coda CLI” brand anchors the top-left and the hamburger/user menu sits top-right—matching the dashboard hub and delivering native-app ergonomics across the site.
- Unified all legal contact points to `cody@codacli.com`, moved future-facing policies into `legal/drafts/`, and tightened the login UI so legal acknowledgement is front and center.

## Details

- **Legal Center**
  - Added `app/(public)/legal/` routes plus a markdown renderer (`components/legal/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`) so policy updates stay in sync with the repo.
  - The footer now links directly to Terms, Privacy, Cookies, and the Legal Center for quick access everywhere.

- **Consent Logging**
  - New `document_acceptances` schema + migration capture per-user acknowledgements. NextAuth events ensure every successful login stores the acceptance if it’s missing.
  - Sign-in forms received a shared `ConsentNotice` so users must confirm they’ve read the policies before credentials are processed.

- **UI Polish**
  - Public/legal pages inherit the glowing dashboard header, and the header layout flexes gracefully from desktop to mobile.
  - The login experience now makes the legal agreement unmistakable across password and magic-link flows.

- **Policy Updates**
  - All published documents now list `cody@codacli.com` as the sole contact address.
  - Draft policies (SLA, billing, API terms, etc.) live under `legal/drafts/` until supporting processes ship.

## Next Steps

- Rotate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` post-deploy to invalidate old sessions so existing users hit the new consent screen.
- Mirror the checkbox/acceptance flow inside the CLI when that onboarding ships.
- Expand Playwright/e2e coverage around the new legal routes and consent logging once the test environment supports binding.

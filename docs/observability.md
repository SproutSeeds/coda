## Dashboard Recommendations
-
- Track import success ratio by plotting `ideas_import_complete` / (`ideas_import_complete` + `ideas_import_error`).
- Alert when `ideas_import_error` exceeds a rolling threshold or when `duration` (ms) crosses service-level budgets.
- Use `idea_restored` and `idea_purged` to ensure the undo cron is running. If events disappear, verify the Vercel Cron job and `CRON_SECRET` configuration.

## Logging Tips
- Server actions already surface stack traces in Vercel logs. Pair event data with request IDs for incident reports.
- When running locally, watch the Next.js terminal output for import validation errorsâ€”the import server action logs schema issues before throwing.

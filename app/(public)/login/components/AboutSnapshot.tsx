        I built CodaCLI because I’m scatter minded in the best and worst ways. I can have five brilliant ideas in a morning, but
        the moment I open a blank document I freeze—how do I format it, what do I do with it after it’s typed, how do I turn that
        spark into a real plan? I needed a place where the idea could land without friction and grow naturally.

        <p>Capture the thought first, tidy later. Drop a sentence, a lyric, a grocery list item, a feature pitch—everything lives in one flow.</p>
        <p>Break the idea into bite-sized feature cards, shuffle them, and see exactly where the value sits as it evolves.</p>
        <p>Track the work, note the value proposition, and keep the implementation path in sight while CodaCLI stays aligned beside you.</p>

        People ask me, “Cody, when should I use this app?” My answer: when your Notes app is overflowing with half-finished projects.
        Before CodaCLI I dumped everything into Notes—songs, recipes, software ideas, meeting recaps—and nothing connected. Now I
        capture the spark here, move it forward step by step, and let integrations do the busywork. Today it’s an idea tracking
        hub; tomorrow it’s a fully agentic system whose only job is to help your idea see the light of day.

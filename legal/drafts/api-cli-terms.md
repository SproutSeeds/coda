These API & CLI License Terms ("API Terms") apply when you access Coda's APIs, SDKs, webhooks, or command-line tools. They supplement the [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md).

## 1. License Grant
We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the APIs and CLI solely to integrate your applications with the Service and manage your authorized workspaces.

## 2. Authentication & Credentials
- Keep API keys, tokens, and magic-link credentials confidential.
- Do not share credentials with third parties or embed them in client-side code.
- Rotate credentials immediately if compromised.

## 3. Usage Limits
- Follow published rate limits, pagination, and backoff policies.
- Do not exceed allocated compute/storage or reverse engineer non-public endpoints.
- We may throttle or suspend clients that degrade Service performance.

## 4. Attribution & Branding
You may state that your application integrates with Coda, but you must not use our trademarks in a way that implies endorsement. Follow any branding guidelines we publish.

## 5. Prohibited Uses
You may not:
- Repackage or resell API or CLI outputs as a competing service without a reseller agreement.
- Use the APIs to upload spam, malicious code, or infringing content.
- Build derivatives that obscure our rate-limit, security, or analytics instrumentation.

## 6. Updates & Deprecations
We may modify or deprecate endpoints with 90 days' notice for materially breaking changes. For security or compliance reasons we may accelerate timelines. Maintain compatibility with the latest CLI major version within six months of release.

## 7. Monitoring
We may collect telemetry (e.g., method names, latency metrics) to operate the APIs. We reserve the right to audit integrations for compliance with these API Terms.

## 8. Open Source Components
The CLI may include third-party open source libraries governed by their respective licenses. Those licenses apply alongside these API Terms.

## 9. Suspension & Termination
We may suspend or revoke API access if you violate these API Terms, the AUP, or if needed to protect the Service. We will attempt to notify you unless prohibited by law or security concerns.

## 10. Changes
We may update these API Terms. Material updates will be communicated via email or dashboard notice. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

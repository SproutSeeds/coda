This Refund & Billing Policy explains how Coda CLI, Inc. ("Coda") handles billing, renewals, and refunds for paid plans. It supplements the [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md).

## 1. Plan Types
- **Free tier:** No charge; usage limits defined in product documentation.
- **Subscription plans:** Billed monthly or annually in advance.
- **Usage-based add-ons:** Billed in arrears based on metered consumption (e.g., additional idea storage, API credits).

## 2. Payment Methods & Authorization
We accept major credit cards and other methods listed at checkout. By providing a payment method, you authorize us to charge applicable fees, taxes, and recurring charges until you cancel.

## 3. Renewals & Cancellations
- Subscriptions renew automatically on each billing cycle unless cancelled at least one day before renewal.
- Cancel via the dashboard or by contacting cody@codacli.com. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current paid term.
- Usage-based charges continue to accrue until the account is downgraded or closed.

## 4. Refunds
- **Subscription fees:** Non-refundable once a billing period begins, except where required by law or covered under Section 5.
- **Metered usage:** Non-refundable once invoiced.
- **Promotional credits:** Have no cash value and expire per their terms.

## 5. Service Credits & SLA Remedies
If we fail to meet the uptime commitments in the [Service Level Agreement](./service-level-agreement.md), your sole remedy is the service credit described there. Credits offset future invoices and cannot be exchanged for cash.

## 6. Disputed Charges
Disputes must be raised within 30 days of the charge by emailing cody@codacli.com with supporting details. We will investigate and respond within 10 business days.

## 7. Taxes
Fees exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for applicable sales, VAT, GST, or similar taxes. We may charge taxes based on the billing address you provide.

## 8. Chargebacks & Collections
Chargebacks may result in immediate suspension. Unpaid amounts may incur late fees or interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum allowed by law). You agree to reimburse collection costs, including reasonable attorney fees.

## 9. Currency & Exchange Rates
Fees are charged in U.S. dollars unless specified. If we offer local currency billing, exchange rates are set by our payment processor at the time of the transaction.

## 10. Changes
We may update pricing or this policy with 30 days' notice. Continued use after the change takes effect constitutes acceptance of new rates.

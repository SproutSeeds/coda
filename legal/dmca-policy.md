This policy explains how Coda CLI, Inc. ("Coda") responds to notices alleging copyright infringement under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").

## 1. Designated Agent
Send DMCA notices to cody@codacli.com.

## 2. Submitting a Notice
To request removal of allegedly infringing material hosted via the Service, your notice must include:
1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed.
2. Identification of the material to be removed (URL, project ID, or other specific location).
3. Your contact information (name, address, phone, email).
4. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
5. A statement that the information in the notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
6. Your physical or electronic signature.

Incomplete notices may be rejected.

## 3. Counter-Notification
If your content is removed due to a DMCA notice and you believe the removal was mistaken or you have authorization to use the material, you may file a counter-notification that includes:
1. The specific content removed and where it appeared before removal.
2. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
3. Your consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, and that you will accept service of process from the original complainant.
4. Your contact information and signature.

We will forward valid counter-notifications to the original complainant. If we do not receive notice of legal action within 10 business days, we may restore the content.

## 4. Repeat Infringers
We may terminate accounts of repeat infringers consistent with Section 512(i) of the DMCA.

## 5. Misuse
Filing fraudulent or bad-faith notices or counter-notifications may result in account suspension and legal liability.

## 6. Questions
Contact cody@codacli.com for guidance before filing.

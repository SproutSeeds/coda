## 1. Overview
This Privacy Policy explains how Coda CLI, Inc. ("Coda", "we", "us") collects, uses, and shares personal information when you use codacli.com, the Coda CLI, and related services (the "Service").

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Provided by you:** name, email, password (hashed), organization or workspace details, invitees, and the idea content, feature notes, or attachments you choose to upload.
- **Automatically:** IP address, device and browser headers, CLI version, timestamps, page views, search queries, error logs, and cookie identifiers.
- **From third parties:** authentication providers you connect (e.g., email delivery partners), analytics services you enable (e.g., PostHog), and database/storage vendors (e.g., Neon) acting as processors.

## 3. How We Use Information
- Operate and secure the dashboard, CLI, and APIs.
- Authenticate users, issue magic links, and enforce rate limits (via Upstash).
- Send transactional emails (password resets, notifications) and optional product updates (opt-out available).
- Analyze usage (e.g., anonymized metrics via Vercel Analytics or PostHog) to improve features and detect abuse.
- Comply with legal obligations, enforce the Terms, and protect the Service and users.

## 4. Sharing
We share personal data only with:
- **Infrastructure providers** such as Vercel (hosting/CDN), Neon (Postgres database), and Upstash (Redis rate limiting).
- **Analytics providers** like PostHog or Vercel Analytics if enabled for your workspace.
- **Email delivery services** you configure (e.g., SMTP provider) or that we use to send magic links.
- **Authorities** or legal counsel when required by law or to protect rights.
We do not sell personal data or use it for third-party advertising.

## 5. Cookies & Tracking
We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies for authentication, user preferences, and analytics. Browser settings may limit cookies; disabling them can affect functionality.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain personal information while your account is active. If you close your account, we delete or anonymize personal data within 30 days unless legal, security, or audit requirements mandate longer retention (e.g., backup snapshots retained up to 90 days).

## 7. Security
We implement encryption in transit, role-based access controls, logging, and periodic security reviews. No system is infallible; notify us immediately of suspected unauthorized access at security@codacli.com.

## 8. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port personal data, or object to certain processing. Submit requests to privacy@codacli.com. We will verify your identity and respond within 30 days unless a longer period is permitted by law.

## 9. International Transfers
We operate primarily in the United States using sub-processors listed in our Data Processing Addendum. For EU/UK transfers we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent safeguards.

## 10. Children
The Service is not directed to individuals under 18. If we learn we collected data from a minor, we will delete it.

## 11. Changes
We may update this policy. Material changes will be announced via email or in-app notice. Continued use after the effective date indicates acceptance.

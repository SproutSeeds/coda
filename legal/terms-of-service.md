## 1. Agreement
By creating an account, storing ideas, installing or running the Coda CLI, or accessing any codacli.com endpoint (collectively, the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.

## 2. Services & Eligibility
- You must be at least 18 years old and provide accurate registration information.
- Subject to these Terms, we grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the hosted dashboard, APIs, and CLI binaries solely to manage project ideas and related artifacts.
- Unauthorized resale, sublicensing, or offering the Service as your own product is prohibited.

## 3. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Attempt to breach, probe, or disable security or rate limits (e.g., Upstash Redis safeguards).
- Upload or store unlawful, infringing, confidential, or harmful material without proper rights.
- Automate scraping or export of data beyond documented CLI and API limits, or otherwise disrupt other users.
- Misrepresent your affiliation or impersonate another person.
We may throttle, suspend, or terminate access if you violate this section or if your use threatens the Service.

## 4. Accounts, Access & Security
You are responsible for safeguarding passwords, magic-link access, and CLI tokens, and for all actions taken under your account. Notify us immediately at security@codacli.com if you suspect unauthorized use so we can revoke tokens or disable accounts.

## 5. Feedback
If you provide feedback, feature ideas, code snippets, or sample prompts, you grant Coda CLI, Inc. (“Coda”) a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, modify, and incorporate that feedback without compensation.

## 6. Service Availability & Support
- We operate the Service on providers such as Vercel, Neon, and Upstash. Availability may be interrupted for maintenance, provider outages, or emergencies.
- Support is provided on a reasonable-effort basis via the channels listed on our site; paid tiers (if introduced) may include additional commitments described in plan details.
- Service credits or time extensions—not refunds—are the exclusive remedy for any availability commitment we explicitly publish.

## 7. Payment & Taxes
If we introduce paid features or subscriptions, you authorize us to charge the payment method on file for the displayed price. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law. You are responsible for applicable taxes, duties, and government charges.

## 8. Intellectual Property
All Service code, documentation, and trademarks are owned by Coda. You retain ownership of the content you store (ideas, features, attachments) but grant us a license to host, process, analyze, and display that content to provide and improve the Service. Removing your data or closing your account ends that license, except where retention is required under Section 10.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms, fail to pay fees, expose the Service to security risk, or if required by law. You may cancel at any time via the dashboard or CLI. Upon termination we will follow the retention schedule in the Privacy Policy, deleting or anonymizing data unless legal obligations require longer storage.

## 10. Data & Privacy
Processing of personal data is described in our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md). You agree that we may use anonymized and aggregated metrics (e.g., feature usage counts, error rates) to operate and improve the Service.

## 11. Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CODA'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE FEES PAID BY YOU DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. CODA IS NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.

## 13. Indemnification
You will defend and indemnify Coda against claims arising from your misuse of the Service, violation of these Terms, or infringement by content you submit.

## 14. Governing Law & Venue
These Terms are governed by California law, excluding conflict of law rules. The state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes.

## 15. Changes
We may update these Terms. For material changes we will notify you via email or in-app notice. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. We may require re-acceptance for significant updates.

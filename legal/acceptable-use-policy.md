This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") describes activities that are prohibited when using codacli.com, the Coda dashboard, CLI, APIs, and related services (the "Service"). It forms part of the [Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md). Capitalized terms inherit the meanings in the Terms.

## 1. Security & Abuse
You may not:
- Breach, probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network without written authorization.
- Circumvent authentication, rate limits, or usage quotas.
- Interfere with Service availability via denial-of-service attacks, botnets, or abusive automation.
- Distribute malware, spyware, or malicious scripts through idea exports, CLI packages, or integrations.

## 2. Misuse of the Service
- Do not use the Service to store or transmit unlawful, infringing, or harmful content.
- Phishing, social engineering, or attempts to collect credentials from other users are prohibited.
- Scraping or bulk exporting beyond documented CLI/API limits is not allowed.
- Do not resell, white-label, or offer the Service as a competing product without a reseller agreement.

## 3. Intellectual Property & Content Standards
- Respect intellectual-property rights. Only upload materials you own or are authorized to use.
- Remove copyrighted content if you lose rights to it. We process DMCA requests under our [DMCA Policy](./dmca-policy.md).
- Content advocating violence, hate, or discrimination is banned.

## 4. Privacy & Data Protection
- Do not attempt to deanonymize aggregated metrics or access another workspace's data.
- Comply with applicable privacy laws when importing personal data. Provide notice and obtain consent where required.

## 5. Automated Access
Automation must respect documented rate limits. You may not:
- Use shared credentials or leaked tokens.
- Run unattended scripts that materially degrade Service performance or stability.
- Interfere with Upstash Redis safeguards designed to protect shared infrastructure.

## 6. Enforcement
We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations. We may suspend or terminate accounts, throttle traffic, disable features, or remove content to protect the Service and other users. For severe or repeated violations, we may notify hosting providers, affected organizations, or law-enforcement authorities.

## 7. Reporting
Report abuse or suspected violations to cody@codacli.com. Provide logs, timestamps, and reproduction steps where possible. We will acknowledge reports within two business days.

## 8. Changes
We may update this AUP. Material updates will be announced via email or in-app notice. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

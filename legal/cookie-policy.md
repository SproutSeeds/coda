This Cookie Policy explains how Coda CLI, Inc. ("Coda", "we", "us") uses cookies and similar technologies on codacli.com, the Coda dashboard, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). It supplements our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md).

## 1. What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. We also use pixels, local storage, and similar technologies (together, "Cookies") to recognize repeat visits, remember preferences, and measure performance.

## 2. Categories of Cookies We Use
- **Strictly necessary:** Authentication tokens, session cookies, CSRF protection, and rate-limit markers required for the Service to function. These cannot be disabled.
- **Functionality:** Preference cookies that remember your theme and in-app layout choices.

We do not currently set optional analytics or advertising cookies.

## 3. Third-Party Cookies
Third parties involved in delivering the Service may place essential cookies when you interact with the product:
- **Vercel** provides hosting and edge caching for the dashboard.
- **Email delivery providers** embed open-tracking pixels in transactional emails to confirm delivery.
All subprocessors are contractually required to use personal data only to provide services to Coda.

## 4. Managing Preferences
- Because we only set essential and functional cookies today, a cookie consent banner is not shown. When optional analytics ship, you will be able to opt in or out before they are enabled.
- You can clear or block cookies using your browser settings. Blocking strictly necessary cookies may break authentication, CLI sync, or rate-limit protection.

## 5. Retention
Session cookies expire when you log out or close your browser. Persistent preference cookies typically last 12 months unless you clear them sooner. Analytics cookies respect the retention limits of their providers (see Annex B of the DPA).

## 6. Updates
We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in technology or regulation. Material changes will trigger a new consent request where required. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

## 7. Contact
For questions, email cody@codacli.com.

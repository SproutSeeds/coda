# The Wanderer's Path - Philosophy & Master Plan

> "The infinite source is within. Mana is not given—it is generated through the act of creation itself."

---

## Overview

The Wanderer's Path is Coda's onboarding and progression system. It is a **10-stage journey** that teaches users the product through doing, wrapped in fantasy language that honors the creative process.

**Critical Design Principle**: Everyone walks the same path. The choice at `/choose-path` determines **what you earn**, not **what you do**.

---

## The Two Paths: Same Journey, Different Rewards

### The Choice (`/choose-path`)

When users first arrive, they choose their destiny:

| Path | Cost | Reward System | Access |
|------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Wanderer** | Free | Crystallized Sand (time) | Stages 1-5 |
| **Sorcerer** | $25/mo or $240/yr | Mana Pool Unlocks (power) | Stages 1-10 |

### Key Insight: Sorcerers Start at Stage 1

**Even if you pay for Sorcerer, you begin at Stage 1.** The subscription doesn't skip the journey—it changes what you unlock along the way and grants access to the advanced stages (6-10).

This ensures:
1. Every user learns the product properly
2. Power is earned through action, not just payment
3. The journey has meaning regardless of billing status

## The Two Resources

### Mana (Progress Energy)

**What it is**: Energy generated through creation. The byproduct of will and follow-through.

**Philosophy**: Mana isn't given or purchased—it manifests when you trust yourself and do the thing. Every task completed is proof of will.

**For Wanderers**: Mana fills a progress bar within each stage. Complete all 5 tasks = stage complete = earn sand.

**For Sorcerers**: Mana fills the same progress bar, but completion unlocks portions of their 200k mana pool instead of earning sand.

### Crystallized Sand (Wanderer's Currency)

**What it is**: Solidified time, earned by Wanderers through completing stages.

**How it works**:
- 6 scoops per stage = 6 days of access
- 5 stages × 6 scoops = 30 days total
- Displayed in an hourglass widget

**Philosophy**: Time isn't bought—it's crystallized from effort. You didn't just get more time; you created it.

### Mana Pool (Sorcerer's Currency)

**What it is**: The Sorcerer's power reservoir, unlocked through the journey.

**How it works**:
- 200k total mana pool
- Unlocked progressively: 40k per stage in Part I
- Additional unlocks and bonus mana in Part II
- Used to power AI features, DevMode, and advanced tools

**Philosophy**: Power isn't instant—it's unlocked through proving mastery. Even with a subscription, you earn your capabilities.

## The `/choose-path` Page

### Design Philosophy

The choose-path page is the **first page new users see** after authentication. It presents the two paths as a meaningful choice, not a paywall.

### Visual Design

- Dark, mystical background with floating particles
- Two cards: Wanderer (purple/silver) and Sorcerer (gold/amber)
- Cards are compact initially, expand on selection to show full details
- Particle effects and sparkle burst on selection
- 3D tilt effect on hover for interactivity
- No scrolling required—everything visible on one screen

### UX Flow

1. User arrives at `/choose-path`
2. Sees two compact cards side by side
3. Clicks a card to expand and see full details
4. Can press ESC or X to collapse and reconsider
5. Confirms selection to begin journey
6. Redirected to `/dashboard/path` to see Stage 1

### Card Content

**Wanderer Card (Expanded)**:
- "The Wanderer's Path"
- "Begin your journey"
- Description of earning crystallized sand
- Reward breakdown: 6 days per stage, 30 days total
- Features list
- "Begin the Journey" CTA

**Sorcerer Card (Expanded)**:
- "The Sorcerer's Ascension"
- "Unlock your power"
- Description of mana pool and advanced features
- Pricing: $25/mo or $240/yr (annual saves $60)
- Features list (AI, DevMode, Collaboration)
- Monthly and Annual CTAs → Stripe checkout

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Journey progress table
journey_progress (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id text UNIQUE REFERENCES auth_user(id),
  chosen_path text, -- 'wanderer' | 'sorcerer'
  current_stage integer DEFAULT 1,
  total_mana integer DEFAULT 0,
  crystallized_sand integer DEFAULT 0,
  mana_pool_unlocked integer DEFAULT 0,
  bonus_mana_earned integer DEFAULT 0,
  tasks_completed jsonb,
  features_unlocked text[],
  stages_completed jsonb,
  meditation_unlocked boolean DEFAULT false,
  wanderer_path_completed boolean DEFAULT false,
  sorcerer_ascension_completed boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

-- User table additions
auth_user (
  ...
  chosen_path text,
  path_chosen_at timestamp,
  trial_ends_at timestamp
)
```

### Key Files

```
lib/journey/
├── constants.ts    # All 10 stages defined
├── types.ts        # TypeScript interfaces
├── progress.ts     # Progress tracking utilities

```

### Tracking Integration

Every relevant server action calls `trackJourneyAction()`:

```typescript
// In createIdeaAction
await trackJourneyAction(user.id, "create_idea", idea.id);

// In updateIdeaAction
await trackJourneyAction(user.id, "add_idea_notes", idea.id);

// etc.
```

The tracker:
1. Checks if user has chosen a path
2. Maps action to potential task completions
3. Verifies task conditions are met
4. Marks task complete (one-time only)
5. Awards mana and checks for stage completion
6. Awards stage rewards (sand or mana pool unlock)

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Progress Through Action Only
No passive mana regeneration (until Meditation is unlocked at Stage 10). No timers. No "check back later." Power comes from doing.

### 2. Same Journey, Different Rewards
The choice isn't about skipping content—it's about what you earn along the way. Both paths prove themselves.

### 3. One-Time Completion
Each task can only be completed once. Similar future actions don't re-trigger completed tasks. New quests would start fresh.

### 4. Transparent Progress
Users always see exactly where they are, what's ahead, and what they'll earn. No hidden gates.

### 5. Celebration Without Manipulation
Stage completions are celebrated genuinely. The reward is real and earned.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price | Billing |
|------|-------|---------|
| Wanderer | Free | N/A |
| Sorcerer Monthly | $25/month | Monthly |
| Sorcerer Annual | $240/year ($20/mo) | Yearly (save $60) |

---

## Success Metrics

**Primary**: Trial-to-paid conversion rate

**Secondary**:
- % of users completing each stage
- Path selection ratio (Wanderer vs Sorcerer)
- Average time to Stage 5 completion
- Sorcerer Stage 6-10 completion rates
- Churn after path completion

---

## The Deeper Message

The Wanderer's Path isn't gamification for engagement metrics. It's a philosophy made tangible:

**Your power is yours to unlock.**

We don't give you capabilities. We don't sell you shortcuts. You earn them through the act of building something meaningful. The mana comes from within. The sand is crystallized will. The sorcerer's power is proven mastery.

When you complete the journey, you haven't just "unlocked" features. You've proven—to yourself—that you can transform nothing into something. That's the real reward.
